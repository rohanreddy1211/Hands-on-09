Hash Table Implementation; 
Description:
This is a Python implementation of a Hash Table that uses:

Multiplication and Division Methods for the hash function. Chaining with Doubly Linked Lists for collision resolution. Dynamic resizing (growth and shrink) based on load factors. A generic design that allows any hash function to be easily plugged in. The implementation is entirely done using C-style arrays (no Python lists or libraries like collections). The hash table dynamically grows when the load factor exceeds 75% and shrinks when it falls below 25%.

Features Hash Function: Combines multiplication and division methods using the constant A = 0.618033 (related to the golden ratio). Collision Resolution: Implemented via chaining using doubly linked lists. Dynamic Resizing: When the table becomes full (load factor > 75%), it doubles in size. When the table becomes sparsely populated (load factor < 25%), it halves in size. Basic Operations: Insert: Insert a key-value pair into the hash table. Get: Retrieve the value associated with a key. Remove: Remove a key-value pair. Print Table: Print the entire hash table showing the contents of each bucket.
